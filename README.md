# LubbockGreenWitchSucculents
Wanted to learn some angular. My mom is playing with succulents and selling them. Seemed like a good compromise. 
# To deploy to GH pages
Please install angular-cli-ghpages this automates the entire process. 

If not you are just going to grab the dist folder. Switch branches to GH-pages. Paste. Commit and push. 

OR use the better method of: 
* `npm build`
* `npm deploy`

# Running Locally
Run on the command line: 
* `ng serve` or `npm start`
